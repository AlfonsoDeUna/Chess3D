HTML5/WebGL 3D Chess Game

Using the pretty good [javascript chess AI developped by Gary Linscott][1], I developped an interactive 3D chessboard with some UI to start a game and undo, as well as save and loading in PGN format.

My code should be thoroughly commented.

You can try it [here][3]


Enjoy (:
