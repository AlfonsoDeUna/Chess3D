HTML5/WebGL 3D Chess Game

Using the pretty good javascript chess AI developped by Gary Linscott ( https://github.com/glinscott/Garbochess-JS ), I developped an interactive 3D chessboard with some UI to start a game and undo, as well as save and loading in PGN format.

My code should be thoroughly commented.
